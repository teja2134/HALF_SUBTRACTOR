# HALF_SUBTRACTOR

# AIM:

To simulate and synthesis Half Subtractor using vivado.

# Apparatus Required:

vivado 2023.2 software.

# Procedure:
STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.

STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.

# verilog code:

module halfsubtractor(a,b,diff,borrow);

input a,b;

output diff,borrow;

xor g1(diff,a,b);

and g2(borrow,~a,b);

endmodule

# output:

# Result:
 Thus,the verilog program for half subtractor has been simulated and verified successfully.
